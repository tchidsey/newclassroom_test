Windows Python 3.11.3 64bit

To run the test
python -m unittest


I used Python and the unittest framework to make api calls to the endpoint. I used a library that needs to be installed to make http request. I chose this as it is pretty quick to bring up some api test that can be used right away. It is one of the languages that was with in the description so I wanted to create something in an in house language. Python is quickly cathing on in the QA world for automation.


I have 7 test:

Test the count by gender
Test the count by country
Test count password complexity_non alpha
Test count password comlexity alpha characters
Test verify result count for top value
Test missing payload
Test missing manditory values payload

Defects/Bugs

1. Mandatory fields for the payload are not displaying an error when leaving the field blank.

I have an automated test that verifies the mandatory fields should display an error if you leave items out. When the test was executed it was expecting a 400 error but we are still getting a 200 Success
Automated test:  test_missing_mandatory_values_payload
Endpoint: "https://census-toy.nceng.net/prod/toy-census"
Payload: 
 payload = {

Response: Success 200

Reproduction steps:
1. Make a request to the https://census-toy.nceng.net/prod/toy-census edpoint with "actionType" empty
2. Send off the request with a payload and missing actionType value
3. Verify the response comes back 

Expect: The response should come back with a 400 error and some message for the user to know they are missing a field

Actual: The reponse comes back as a success and now error




2. Sending in a request with no or an empty payload still returns a success and 200 status

I have an automated test that sends in am empty payload to verify and error status and message are displayed. When the test sends off the payload, the reponse comes back as a success.

Payload: {}
Response: Success 200 status

Reproduction steps:
1. Make a request to the https://census-toy.nceng.net/prod/toy-census edpoint with an empty payload
2. Send off the request with a payload and missing actionType value
3. Verify the response comes back 

Expect: The response should come back with a 400 error and some message for the user to know they are missing a field or payload

Actual: The reponse comes back as a success and now error


3. While developing the test to verify the 'top' sort parameter, I noticed this value is not changing the output of the response. This value seems to be ignored at this time.

Payload:  payload = {
            "actionType": "CountByGender",
            "top" : str(num),
            "users": [{"gender": gender} for gender in self.genders]
            
        }
        
 Response: [
    {
        "name": "AU",
        "value": 1
    }
]

Reproduction:
1. Make a request to the https://census-toy.nceng.net/prod/toy-census edpoint with 'top' given some numerical value
2. Send off the request with a payload and missing actionType value
3. Verify the response comes back 

Expect: The response should come back with a list of values matching the count given for 'top'

Actual: The reponse comes back as a single item
