pip install requests
requests                   2.28.2

To run the test
python -m unittest


I used Python and the unittest framework to make api calls to the endpoint. I used a library that needs to be installed to make http request. I chose this as it is pretty quick to bring up some api test that can be used right away. It is one of the languages that was with in the description so I wanted to create something in an in house language. Python is quickly cathing on in the QA world for automation.


I have 7 test:

Test the count by gender
Test the count by country
Test count password complexity_non alpha
Test count password comlexity alpha characters
Test verify result count for top value
Test missing payload
Test missing manditory values payload
